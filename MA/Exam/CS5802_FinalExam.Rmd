## Section I: Modern Data

**Question 1: (Total 15 marks)**

i) Explain, with examples, why understandable code matters for data analysis **(4 MARKS)**

    -- Answer here  



ii) Edit and improve understandability of the R code fragment below.  The code: 

    1. sets a seed for a random number generator  
    2. generates some random numbers  
    3. checks if the sample mean is less or equal/greater than the population mean, i.e., the mean parameter for rnorm()  

    Note that the code works as intended.  Retain the original version and edit the **second** code chunk.  Explain the rationale for your changes.  **(6 MARKS)** 

```{r}
# Unedited version - you are advised not to update this version though you might wish to execute it.

p <- function(){
# Checking code sort of 
  q <- 1234;P<-q
set.seed(P);return(q)      } #end of definition

    p() # Call function to do stuff
pP<-20;pp <-rnorm(n=pP,pP,sd  =pP/10);Q<-mean(pp)    
   if(Q<pP){message("The sample mean is less than the population mean")}else{message("The sample mean is equal or greater than the population mean")}
```


```{r}
# Edit and improve the understandability of this version.  

p <- function(){
# Checking code sort of 
  q <- 1234;P<-q
set.seed(P);return(q)      } #end of definition

    p() # Call function to do stuff
pP<-20;pp <-rnorm(n=pP,pP,sd  =pP/10);Q<-mean(pp)    
   if(Q<pP){message("The sample mean is less than the population mean")}else{message("The sample mean is equal or greater than the population mean")}
```

iii) Outline the advice you would give to a data scientist to produce an understandable and reproducible analysis.  **(5 MARKS)**

    -- Answer here  




**Question 2: (Total 25 Marks)**

This question is based on a fictitious data set which *you* need to `load()` using the following code.  

```{r}
# You should run this code chunk to obtain the data set as a data frame named sexBMIdata
remoteFileName <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjshepperd/CS5702-Data/master/CS5802_sexBMIdata.Rda"
load(file = url(remoteFileName))
```

### Meta Data for sexBMIdata 

1. Sex: {Male,Female}  
2. Age: in whole years  
3. Height: in metres
4. Weight: in kilograms  
5: BMI: body mass index (computed as $$BMI = kg/m^2$$) is an estimate of body fat based on height and weight.  It is broadly interpreted as follows:  

    <18.5 = Underweight
    18.5–24.9	= Normal
    25.0–29.9	= Overweight
    30.0+ = Obese


i) Outline a quality checking plan for this data set.  **(5 MARKS)**

    -- Answer here  



ii) Implement your quality plan in R (in the code chunk below).  Use inline comments and additional text as appropriate.  What, if any, data quality issue can you identify?  **(5 MARKS)**  

```{r}
# Add your code to check the data quality 


```

    -- Answer here   



iii) Explain your data cleaning strategy for any problems you have detected.  **(3 MARKS)** 

    -- Answer here  



iv) Use R to implement your data cleaning strategy for any problems you have detected.  **(3 MARKS)** 

```{r}
# R code to implement your data cleaning strategy here

```


v)	Describe and summarise the data set using R.  Explain the purpose of your code.  Use inline comments and additional text as appropriate.  **(4 MARKS)**

```{r}
# R code to compare males and females here

```

    -- Answer here  




**Question 3: (Total 10 Marks)**


i) Explain why the R chunk below fails to work as intended.  Suggest some R code to automatically check for empty strings in a character vector such as `letterVector`.   **(4 MARKS)** 

```{r}
# Part of the question - do not edit
# Create a character vector
letterVector <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "")
# Check whether there are any missing values
is.na(letterVector)
```

    -- Answer here  



```{r}
# Your R code for checking for empty strings in a character vector such as letterVector.

```



ii) In R what does NaN mean?  Give an example of how it might arise?  **(2 MARKS)**

## Section II: Quantitative Data Analysis

**Question 4: (Total 20 Marks)**

A set of 4 Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) sensors have been installed on the Brunel Campus on the North, South, East and West corners of the Lecture Centre. Data is available from these sensors. The sensors measure the concentration of NO2 in the air.The Brunel environmental team have prepared this data using the code in the R chunk below.

```{r}
# Unedited version - you are advised not to update this version though you might wish to execute it.
sensor.readings<-c(115.41, 103.08 ,130.58, 140.15, 129.20 , 85.18 ,125.94 ,163.56 ,147.85 , 86.78, 97.62, 116.30, 112.92, 119.76, 145.25,  34.47, 155.55,  72.41, 149.86,  93.39, 138.12, 122.76, 140.85, 163.31, 108.98, 136.74, 153.31, 167.12, 158.07, 123.17, 112.01,  74.05, 125.86 , 99.26,  73.06, 130.26, 136.56, 114.43, 109.03, 116.22)
sensor.location<-c("n","n","n","n","n","n","n","n","n","n", "s","s","s","s","s","s","s","s","s", "s", "e","e","e","e","e","e","e","e","e","e","w","w","w","w","w","w","w","w","w","w")
sensor.data<-as.data.frame(cbind(sensor.location, sensor.readings))
sensor.data$sensor.readings<-as.numeric(sensor.data$sensor.readings)
head(sensor.data)
```

This dataframe has two columns: sensor.location (n,s,w,e) and sensor.readings.

For your convenience some summary statistics are provided below:

```{r}
#DO NOT EDIT THIS CHUNK
aggregate(sensor.data$sensor.readings~sensor.data$sensor.location, FUN="mean")
```

ii) The Brunel environmental team are interested in knowing if there is a difference in NO2 levels between the four corners of the Lecture Centre. What modelling approach would you use and why? **(5 MARKS)**

    -- Answer here  



iii) Write the R code for the model proposed in the chunk below: **(5 MARKS)**

```{r}

**Question 5: (Total 15 Marks)**

The science museum in London has been collecting survey data from visitors. They shared the table (that is generated by running the code below) that comprises answers to the following two questions:  
  - Would you return to this museum in the future?  
  - Did you visit the IMAX cinema during your visit today?  
  
```{r}
# R code to produce table of visitor survey data
# Do not edit this code
visits<-matrix(c(35,12,10,23), ncol=2)
colnames(visits)<-c("Yes- would return", "No would not")
rownames(visits)<-c("Visited Imax", "Did not visit Imax")
visits
```

i) Explain what approach would you take to testing whether there is a relationship between the answers to these two questions or they are independent. **(5 MARKS)**  

    -- Answer here  



ii) Implement the approach and explain whether the test you ran confirms that the two answers are independent. **(5 MARKS)**  

```{r}
# Edit this version

iii) The science museum now provides you with the raw data and some additional attributes such as: responder-id, age, visited IMAX (yes/no), travel time (in minutes) as well as the answer to the question: "Would you return to this museum in the future?"   
The science museum team wants to know if there are any attributes that make a return visit more likely.
