## Section I: Modern Data

**Question 1: (Total 15 marks)**

i) Explain, with examples, why understandable code matters for data analysis **(4 MARKS)**

    -- Answer here  
Understantable code matters for at least four main reasons. This answer is based loosely on Robert C. Martin's "Clean Code" book.
The most important reason is that the author will not necessarilly build something in one go. they might pick up a project every few months or years. This means that the code needs to be clear and understandable for when they return to it. This is becayse they will not neceserily remember everything.
The second reason is that other people will probably haveaccess or read the code. If it is a group project, or perhaps something that will be open-sourse or on Github, understandability is very impotant. 
The third reason is ease of editing. making changed will not only be more straightforward, but it will allow for the code itself to be less fragile, abd more flexible.
The four reason is that it will take away from unnecessary complexity and repetition. This will ultimately make it run better and require less disk space.


One way to to it is through having variables that carry meaning. For instance, saving objects with unambuguous names helps. Leaving clear explanations when performing certain action, or indeed not performing certain actions means that things will be much clearer for all readers. Things such as explaining assumptions or referring to certain methodologies give clear indication of what was attempted to acchieve.
There are other general principles such as Ockam's razor, in that the simplest solution is probably the best.


ii) Edit and improve understandability of the R code fragment below.  The code: 

    1. sets a seed for a random number generator  
    2. generates some random numbers  
    3. checks if the sample mean is less or equal/greater than the population mean, i.e., the mean parameter for rnorm()  

    Note that the code works as intended.  Retain the original version and edit the **second** code chunk.  Explain the rationale for your changes.  **(6 MARKS)** 

```{r}
# Unedited version - you are advised not to update this version though you might wish to execute it.

p <- function(){
# Checking code sort of 
  q <- 1234;P<-q
set.seed(P);return(q)      } #end of definition

    p() # Call function to do stuff
pP<-20;pp <-rnorm(n=pP,pP,sd  =pP/10);Q<-mean(pp)    
   if(Q<pP){message("The sample mean is less than the population mean")}else{message("The sample mean is equal or greater than the population mean")}
```


```{r}
# Edit and improve the understandability of this version.  

p <- function(){
# Checking code sort of 
  q <- 1234;P<-q
set.seed(P);return(q)      } #end of definition

    p() # Call function to do stuff
pP<-20;pp <-rnorm(n=pP,pP,sd  =pP/10);Q<-mean(pp)    
   if(Q<pP){message("The sample mean is less than the population mean")}else{message("The sample mean is equal or greater than the population mean")}
```

    -- Answer here  

```{r}
# Edit and improve the understandability of this version.  

p <- function(){
# Checking code sort of 
  q <- 1234;P<-q
set.seed(P);return(q)      } #end of definition

    p() # Call function to do stuff
pP<-20;pp <-rnorm(n=pP,pP,sd  =pP/10);Q<-mean(pp)    
   if(Q<pP){message("The sample mean is less than the population mean")}else{message("The sample mean is equal or greater than the population mean")}
```

    1. sets a seed for a random number generator  
    2. generates some random numbers  
    3. checks if the sample mean is less or equal/greater than the population mean, i.e., the mean parameter for rnorm()  

    Note that the code works as intended.  Retain the original version and edit the **second** code chunk.  Explain the rationale for your changes.  **(6 MARKS)** 
iii) Outline the advice you would give to a data scientist to produce an understandable and reproducible analysis.  **(5 MARKS)**

    -- Answer here  




**Question 2: (Total 25 Marks)**

This question is based on a fictitious data set which *you* need to `load()` using the following code.  

```{r}
# You should run this code chunk to obtain the data set as a data frame named sexBMIdata
remoteFileName <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjshepperd/CS5702-Data/master/CS5802_sexBMIdata.Rda"
load(file = url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjshepperd/CS5702-Data/master/CS5802_sexBMIdata.Rda"))
```

### Meta Data for sexBMIdata 

1. Sex: {Male,Female}  
2. Age: in whole years  
3. Height: in metres
4. Weight: in kilograms  
5: BMI: body mass index (computed as $$BMI = kg/m^2$$) is an estimate of body fat based on height and weight.  It is broadly interpreted as follows:  

    <18.5 = Underweight
    18.5–24.9	= Normal
    25.0–29.9	= Overweight
    30.0+ = Obese


i) Outline a quality checking plan for this data set.  **(5 MARKS)**

    -- Answer here  
I will first check for missing values, or values which do not make sense. This will be done using the is.na() function, as well as elements from the validate package. Please install validate if needed.
I will then test whether the information is correct. I can compare the BMI to the height and weight using the equation provided.

I will also do a summary


ii) Implement your quality plan in R (in the code chunk below).  Use inline comments and additional text as appropriate.  What, if any, data quality issue can you identify?  **(5 MARKS)**  

```{r}

library(validate)
# Add your code to check the data quality 
summary(sexBMIdata)
table(is.na(sexBMIdata))
sexBMIdataCheck = check_that(sexBMIdata,
                        sexBMIdata$Sex == "Male" | sexBMIdata$Sex == "Female",
                        sexBMIdata$Age >= 0,
                        sexBMIdata$Height >= 0,
                        sexBMIdata$Weight >= 0,
                        sexBMIdata$BMI >= 0)
barplot(sexBMIdataCheck, main = "BMI Data Verification")
```




    -- Answer here   
I can see that of the 500 piece of iinformation, one is not available.Is is somebody's BMI.


iii) Explain your data cleaning strategy for any problems you have detected.  **(3 MARKS)** 

    -- Answer here  



iv) Use R to implement your data cleaning strategy for any problems you have detected.  **(3 MARKS)** 

```{r}
# R code to implement your data cleaning strategy here

```


v)	Describe and summarise the data set using R.  Explain the purpose of your code.  Use inline comments and additional text as appropriate.  **(4 MARKS)**  

```{r}

hist(sexBMIdata$Age, prob= T)
lines(density(sexBMIdata$Age), col = "red")
hist(sexBMIdata$Height, prob= T)
lines(density(sexBMIdata$Height), col = "red")
hist(sexBMIdata$Weight, prob= T)
lines(density(sexBMIdata$Weight), col = "red")
hist(sexBMIdata$BMI, prob= T)
lines(density(sexBMIdata$BMI), col = "red")

boxplot(sexBMIdata)
# R code to describe and summarise sexBMIdata here

```

    -- Answer here  



vi) Undertake an exploratory data analysis to compare males and females?  What do you learn?  **(5 MARKS)**  

```{r}
# R code to compare males and females here

```

    -- Answer here  




**Question 3: (Total 10 Marks)**


i) Explain why the R chunk below fails to work as intended.  Suggest some R code to automatically check for empty strings in a character vector such as `letterVector`.   **(4 MARKS)** 

```{r}
# Part of the question - do not edit
# Create a character vector
letterVector <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "")
# Check whether there are any missing values
is.na(letterVector)
```

    -- Answer here  
This fails to work as intended because is.na() searches for what are considered missing values. This has a very particular fdefinition in r. It appears in


```{r}
# Your R code for checking for empty strings in a character vector such as letterVector.
letterVectorWorks <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", NA)
is.na(letterVectorWorks)
```



ii) In R what does NaN mean?  Give an example of how it might arise?  **(2 MARKS)**

    -- Answer here  
NaN means not a number.


iii) Why is missingness a problem for data analysis?  **(4 MARKS)**

    -- Answer here  

Missing
Shepperd's book https://bookdown.org/martin_shepperd/ModernDataBook/C5-Cleaning.html explains it well.

## Section II: Quantitative Data Analysis

**Question 4: (Total 20 Marks)**

A set of 4 Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) sensors have been installed on the Brunel Campus on the North, South, East and West corners of the Lecture Centre. Data is available from these sensors. The sensors measure the concentration of NO2 in the air.The Brunel environmental team have prepared this data using the code in the R chunk below.

```{r}
# Unedited version - you are advised not to update this version though you might wish to execute it.
sensor.readings<-c(115.41, 103.08 ,130.58, 140.15, 129.20 , 85.18 ,125.94 ,163.56 ,147.85 , 86.78, 97.62, 116.30, 112.92, 119.76, 145.25,  34.47, 155.55,  72.41, 149.86,  93.39, 138.12, 122.76, 140.85, 163.31, 108.98, 136.74, 153.31, 167.12, 158.07, 123.17, 112.01,  74.05, 125.86 , 99.26,  73.06, 130.26, 136.56, 114.43, 109.03, 116.22)
sensor.location<-c("n","n","n","n","n","n","n","n","n","n", "s","s","s","s","s","s","s","s","s", "s", "e","e","e","e","e","e","e","e","e","e","w","w","w","w","w","w","w","w","w","w")
sensor.data<-as.data.frame(cbind(sensor.location, sensor.readings))
sensor.data$sensor.readings<-as.numeric(sensor.data$sensor.readings)
head(sensor.data)
```

This dataframe has two columns: sensor.location (n,s,w,e) and sensor.readings.

For your convenience some summary statistics are provided below:

```{r}
#DO NOT EDIT THIS CHUNK
aggregate(sensor.data$sensor.readings~sensor.data$sensor.location, FUN="mean")
```

**Question 5: (Total 15 Marks)**

The science museum in London has been collecting survey data from visitors. They shared the table (that is generated by running the code below) that comprises answers to the following two questions:  
  - Would you return to this museum in the future?  
  - Did you visit the IMAX cinema during your visit today?  
  
```{r}
# R code to produce table of visitor survey data
# Do not edit this code
visits<-matrix(c(35,12,10,23), ncol=2)
colnames(visits)<-c("Yes- would return", "No would not")
rownames(visits)<-c("Visited Imax", "Did not visit Imax")
visits
```

i) Explain what approach would you take to testing whether there is a relationship between the answers to these two questions or they are independent. **(5 MARKS)**  

    -- Answer here  
I will check for correlation.


ii) Implement the approach and explain whether the test you ran confirms that the two answers are independent. **(5 MARKS)**  

```{r}
# Edit this version
library(GGally)
cor(visits)
ggcorr(visits)
```

    -- Answer here    
Thos who visited are more likely to visit again. those who did not visit are less likely to visit in future.


iii) The science museum now provides you with the raw data and some additional attributes such as: responder-id, age, visited IMAX (yes/no), travel time (in minutes) as well as the answer to the question: "Would you return to this museum in the future?"   
The science museum team wants to know if there are any attributes that make a return visit more likely.  

What model would you use and why? **(5 MARKS)**

    -- Answer here  

I would use the Dirichlet model if I had better r skills.
