```{r}

dim(CS5801.data)

glimpse(BOSLAA)


BOSLAA = subset(CS5801.data, teamID.x == "BOS" | teamID.x=="LAA")
BOS = subset(CS5801.data, teamID.x == "BOS")
LAA = subset(CS5801.data, teamID.x == "LAA")


```

Things to have
ggplot
dplyr


The first thing that I will do is look at the data as a whole and try to see whenther there is anything that stands out such as unusual figures or trends between all of the teams.

Then I will separate out the data, and take out the two teams that I will example, and see whether there is anything between them.

The third step will be to put all of the team data together, and see whether there is anything that is clear when adding them together.

After these three steps are done, I will try to find and prove any correlants.


```{r}

plot(BOSLAA$weight, BOSLAA$height, "l")

```
